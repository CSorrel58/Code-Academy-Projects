# personal_projects

Each file should contain a specific project I have worked on either through Code Academy or on my own through other training programs from sites like Kaggle, Tableau Public Support, and Dataquest. 

The Code Academy projects should all have a clear label at the top and be written in a way that makes it obvious they are for a student. Basically, the Code Academy ones will look super fancy.

The ones that just contain data and do not include a walkthrough are the projects I have been working on on the side. Please reach out to me with any questions or if you want to learn more about how or why I did something. 

All feedback is appreciated!
