# personal_projects
My personal learning projects
Each file should contain a specific project I have worked on either through Code Academy or on my own. The code Academy projects should all have a clear label at the top and be written in a way that makes it obvious they are for a group.
The ones that just contain data and do not include a walkthrough are the projects I have been working on on the side. Please reach out to me with any questions.
