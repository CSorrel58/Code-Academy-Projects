# Learning Programs

Each file should contain a specific project I have worked on either through Code Academy or on my own through other training programs from sites like Kaggle, Tableau Public Support, and Dataquest. 

The Code Academy projects should all have a clear label at the top and be written in a way that makes it obvious they are for a student. Basically, the Code Academy ones will look super fancy.

If you're going to  pick one or two to look at, i'd recommend Tennis Stats, a challenge project where I applied what I jhave learned about regression models, or the MuscleHub project, which displays some of what I have learned about both SQL and Pandas.

Please reach out to me with any questions or if you want to learn more about how or why I did something. All feedback is appreciated!
